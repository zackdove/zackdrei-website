# Grape!

For our third year module 'web development', Andrei and I built a web app.

Grape is a website used to remember, review and discover wines.

We built grape from scratch using a MVC style Node.js backend, SQL database, and custom styling and front-end JS (no Bootstrap or other libraries used!)
